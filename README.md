 This is a project I prepared for Prof. Albert's Reproducible Research class to build my data analytics skills in R during Spring 2022 at Bryn Mawr College. The goal of the project was to wrangle a dataset
 to run very basic statistics on in accordance with the Registered Report format that encourages reproductible research in the field of Psychology.

 In this project, I write about the ongoing problems with the spread of Lyme disease throughout the United States. I wrangled climate data from endemic regions and wrote a report about the limitations for
 what we can learn from the available data.

 The entire research paper was formatted and produced in an R markdown file.
